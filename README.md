# Python Filters Project

Based on an ISN (Computer and Digital Sciences - in a french highschool) project

## What is it ?

It's a terminal based Python program that let you choose from a list of filters. You can then enter a filename and the filter will be applied to your image.

### Current filters

* Grayscale
* Negative
* RGB Mask
* Sepia tone
* Lower Brightness
* Increase Brightness
* Blur (Gaussian blur)
* Emboss

> Blur and Emboss are based on a convolution matrix, therefore any convolution matrix based filter can be applied theoretically


### What's next ?

I plan to clean the script, and convert it to an image class.
Next step will be to make an UI using PyQt
